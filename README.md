========================

## Abstract
The main aim of this paper is to analyse Kolobrzeg's Urban Bicycle in the context of bicycle traffic generated by the bicycle at individual stations and to analyse strategic documents in Kolobrzeg. 
The analysis of the bicycle traffic volume was performed using the R language, among others, and the data was downloaded via Nextbike API.
The analysis of strategic documents included an analysis of the spatial development conditions and directions, SmartCity development strategies, and a SWOT analysis of spatial policy and cycling infrastructure.
In addition, a survey was carried out on a sample of more than 100 people on urban cycling in Kołobrzeg and the Kołobrzeg cycling infrastructure, and the characteristics of the city of Kołobrzeg were presented. 

The result of the analyses is a draft development concept, which assumes the creation of new Kolobrzeg City Bicycle stations, which are presented on maps created using the QGis software and via the Spatial Information System platform of the City of Kolobrzeg.
